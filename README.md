# CS303-Assignment-1

The code is pretty straightforward. The questions are prompted to the user and ask for user input which is used to modify the array's contents.
The first question is to enter a number to be found in the data set. Based on if the integer is found or not, there is a reply that generates.
Next, the user is asked for an index to modify the data value of. The user picks an index and the next question is to pick an integer to replace it with. There is a statement that generates to display the old and new integer values of that index the user picked.
Third, the user is asked for an integer to add to the end. The data set is displayed at the very end. I added this in, I know it was not required. This helped me make sure my code was working accurately.
Lastly, the user is asked to pick an index they would like to replace or remove from the data set. The array size changes based on what the user picks and it is commented in my file. The user chooses to replace the data value at the index they chose with a 0 or delete it all togther. 


I am attaching a variety of outputs to show how the code works.
